## Shared theme maintenance

Read [THEME.md](THEME.md) before changing shared chrome, MaterialX configuration
or component assets. This repository’s role is: getgo font catalogue.
Shared browser behavior belongs in `fontlab-www-docstheme`; FontLab global menu
source belongs in `img/docs/menu/fontlab.js`, Vexy menu source in
`i.vexy.art/docs/menu/vexy.js`. Keep per-site content, branding and native builds here.
Preserve one menu and one search control, documented ownership defaults, scoped
`.fltheme-components` styles and `du-` component prefixes. Verify final generated
HTML after overlays; a source-only change is not proof of a live deployment.
Do not commit unrelated local edits or hand-edit generated CSS as the source fix.
Work directly unless the current user explicitly requests delegation.
